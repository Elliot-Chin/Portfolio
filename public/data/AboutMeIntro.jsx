const AboutMeIntro = `Hey there, welcome to my portfolio website! My name is Elliot, and I'm originally from the beautiful city of Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. I moved to Canada in 2017 to pursue my studies in software engineering, and I graduated from the University of New Brunswick (UNB) in 2023.

As a software engineer, I aim to create innovative, user-friendly solutions that enhance people's daily lives. I have a strong background in programming languages like Java and Python. I'm always excited to learn about new technologies and tools to stay ahead of the game.

One thing that makes me stand out from other software engineers is my ability to speak four different languages: English, Mandarin, Cantonese, and Malay. This has been incredibly useful in my career as it helps me communicate effectively with clients and colleagues from diverse cultural backgrounds.

You'll probably find me hiking or curled up with a good book when I'm not coding. Being surrounded by nature rejuvenates me, and I love exploring new trails and hidden gems. As for reading, it's a great way to escape into different worlds and broaden my horizons.

Overall, I'm passionate about using technology to positively impact the world, and I'm thrilled about the opportunities that lie ahead in my career. Thanks for checking out my website, and if you have any questions, feel free to message me!`
